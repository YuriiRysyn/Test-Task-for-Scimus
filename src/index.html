              The Top Five Places To Learn To Dive
            </h3>
            <p class="article__post-description">
              Divers are really astronauts; gliding weightless through the ocean we observe alien worlds carpeted
              in vast fields of colourful corals with equally bizarre, enthralling inhabitants - from the foreign
              clicks of dolphins communicating to minute technicolour slugs (nudibranch). And best yet, you don't need
              years of gruelling training or a rocket to experience these watery worlds, just four days and a
              eagle-ray-eyed (sorry) ground control.

              As the nights draw in, the temperature drops (we had a good run) and businesses start to compete for
              the best Christmas TV ad (move aside Elton, Waitrose's Stollen takes the crown), the festive season is
              upon us. So, naturally, we've decided to bypass all of that and look straight ahead to next year, which is
              shaping up to be a good'un. From a very exclusive expedition to the best new openings and
              off-the-beaten track diving adventures.

              Short Haul Winter Diving Destinations

              As we (at least those of us based in Europe) are slowly stepping into the cold of winter and dusting
              off our winter clothing, here at Original Diving, we've compiled our list of some top short-haul
              winter-come-spring diving destinations. Here's a selection of places you can get to for a short break
              where the temperature won't chill your bones and the waters remain unfrozen. Enjoy!

              This year I turn 30. At the start of the year I decided that it was going to be a big year for me;
              figure out my five year plan, set some challenges, say 'yes' to as much as possible and go on some
              unforgettable trips. The five year plan is still a work in progress, however I did say 'yes' to
              completing a ski marathon so that doubled with a challenge.

            Our approach differs from other travel companies; we are a group of dedicated divers, marine biologists
            and travellers who take a creative approach to tailoring luxury diving holidays.

          <br>
          <p class="about-us__text">
            We focus on understanding what you want from your holiday, from trips centred entirely around diving to
            holidays with the odd dive included here and there. No matter your level of dive experience and
            knowledge, we will tailor the perfect holiday to your requirements using a thoughtful approach, focused on the small
            details that make a big difference.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="about-us__text">
            Our aim is to make sure every detail of your holiday is planned to perfection by working with you to hone
            and finesse your itinerary to your exact requirements, from ensuring logistics like transfers and guides
            run like clockwork to giving you access to experiences the average traveller wouldn't find. So you can
            sit
            back, relax and enjoy your Original Diving holiday.
